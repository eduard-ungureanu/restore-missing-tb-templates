- Footer Templates.

You can use the new options (custom post type), to check and restore any of the Theme Builder Templates areas like. Accessing the new areas: Header Templates, Body Templates, Footer Templates will give access to any tempaltes that were previously assing in Theme Builder. 

Once you have identify the template areas, you can edit them just like any nomral post/pages and save them to your Divi Library. 

In the this Video: https://share.getcloudapp.com/8LuonlEj, the Custom Body template that was assigned to All Post Template in Theme Builder is being saved to the Divi Library. 

Note: it would be a good practice to prefix all the Templates Pars (Body, Header, Footer) with the name of that template part, in the previous video the **Body** prefix was used since that is a Custom Body Template. Keeping a consistent name, will help you to indentify each tempalte part (Custom Body, Custom Header, Custom Footer) easily.

#### Step 2
Once the templates parts were saved to the Divi Library the next step is to **recreate and reassign the missing template**.

In Divi > Theme Builder, recreate each of the missing templates and assigned them and use the **Add from Divi Library** option to add back the templates part that were saved at step 1.

In this video, the template that is being recreated is for All Posts: https://share.getcloudapp.com/p9uArB0E.
