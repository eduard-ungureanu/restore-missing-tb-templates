there we can save them to Divi Library, and let the customer know that he can just reacreate the Assignments while loading each Tempalte part (body, header, footer) from Divi Library.

Naming convention for saving the Theme Builder tempaltes to Divi Library

In this example, the prefix **Body** was added since that was a Body Tempalte which was set for the Search Results.

Keeping a consistent name, will help the user to indentify each tempalte part (body, footer, header) easily.
