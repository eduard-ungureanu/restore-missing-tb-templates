Accessing the new areas: Header, Body, Footer will give access to any tempaltes that were previously assing in Theme Builder, from there we can save them to Divi Library, and let the customer know that he can just reacreate the Assignments while loading each Tempalte part (body, header, footer) from Divi Library.

Naming convention for saving the Theme Builder tempaltes to Divi Library:
